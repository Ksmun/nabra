# Nabara

**Nabara** is a simple machine learning project that uses Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict stock closing prices based on historical data stored in a CSV file. The project demonstrates how to preprocess stock data, train multiple SVR models with different kernels, and visualize predictions on a graph.

## Features

- **CSV Data Processing:** Reads historical stock data from a CSV file containing columns like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Converts date strings to ordinal values to use as features for modeling.
- **SVR Models:** Implements three SVR models using different kernels:
  - RBF (Radial Basis Function)
  - Linear
  - Polynomial
- **Visualization:** Plots the historical data along with the predictions of each model and marks the predicted future price on a saved graph image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

```
